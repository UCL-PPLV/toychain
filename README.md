# Toychain

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/certichain/toychain.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/certichain/toychain)

A Coq implementation of a minimalistic blockchain-based consensus protocol.

## Building the Project

### Requirements

* [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) (8.11)
* [Mathematical Components](http://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/)
  (`ssreflect` suffices) (1.10)
* [FCSL PCM library](https://github.com/imdea-software/fcsl-pcm) (1.2.0)

### Building

We recommend installing the requirements via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):
```
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq coq-mathcomp-ssreflect coq-fcsl-pcm
```

Then, run `make clean; make` from the root folder. This will build all
the libraries and check all the proofs.

## Project Structure

The top-level structure consists of the following folders:

* `Structures` - implementations of block forests and chain properties;

* `Systems` - definition of the protocol, its state, and network semantics;

* `Properties` - proved properties of the protocol, e.g., eventual
  consistency for a clique-like network topology;

### Obsolete Files

* `Obsolete` -- properties that might or might not hold, as were
  verified out of many optimistically assumed axioms at the beginning
  of the project.
